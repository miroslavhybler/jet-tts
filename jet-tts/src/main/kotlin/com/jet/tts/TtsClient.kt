/**
 * Simple client class to use [TextToSpeech] feature. Take a look at [Dev blog](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2009/09/introduction-to-text-to-speech-in.html)
 * to understand how [TextToSpeech] works.
 *
 * ## Features
 *
 * ### Text highlight Feature (api >= 26)
 *Using `TtsClient.HighlightMode` to set how you want to highlight currently spoken text:
 * * `SPOKEN_WORD` - `TextTts` will highlight currently spoken sequence (single word in most cases).
 * * `SPOKEN_RANGE_FROM_BEGINNING` - `TextTts` will highlight range from the beggining to the currently spoken sequence.
 * See [HighlightMode].
 *
 * ### Autoscroll Feature (api >= 26)
 * By providing a [androidx.compose.foundation.ScrollState], [TextTts] can use it to autoscroll to
 * currently spoken line. Solution for [androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyColumn] is not avaliable now.
 * Use [rememberTtsClient] to get an instance of [com.jet.tts.TtsClient].
 *
 * ## Navigation Feature
 * It is possible to "navigate" in utterance when `ttsClient.isSpeaking == true`, by clicking into
 * [TextTts] client will navigate speech by clicked word.
 * @since 1.0.0
